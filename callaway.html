<p>Back in the year 2000 when Tiger Woods was in his prime, golf participation and viewership rose to record numbers. However, in the aftermath of Tiger Woods' demise as the world's greatest golfer, no golfer has managed to stand up and take his place. This is a real problem in our opinion as we feel all sports need a star. Whether it be basketball and Steph Curry, soccer and Lionel Messi, or tennis and Roger Federer, each of these sports has someone that excites spectators and keeps them tuning in time and time again. With participation and viewer numbers dwindling, Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY) reduced their presence in the sport. Adidas announced its intention to separate from its golf business TaylorMade and Nike announced the business would no longer produce any golf clubs, bags, or balls. Instead it would focus only on shoes and apparel for the sport. For many, this was a sign that golf was dying and its obituary was being prepared.</p>
